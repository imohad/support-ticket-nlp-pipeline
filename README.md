Customer-support centers process thousands of heterogeneous tickets daily, yet manual triage remains slow, inconsistent, and error-prone—particularly in multilingual settings where urgency and emotion are difficult to gauge. This thesis presents an integrated transformer-based pipeline that jointly performs (a) fine-grained ticket classification (category, department routing, and priority) via a single multi-task BERT model and (b) customer-sentiment analysis using a domain-adapted DistilBERT classifier. Using a real-world corpus of 20,000 anonymized tickets (≈ 95 % English, 3 % Spanish, 2 % German), the multi-task BERT classifier attains 84 % macro-F1 on ticket‐type prediction, 81 % macro-F1 on department routing, and 66 % macro-F1 on priority assignment—improvements of up to 12 percentage points over TF-IDF + SVM baselines . The DistilBERT sentiment model, pre-trained on SST-2, achieves approximately 85 % accuracy on its benchmark and provides real-time sentiment labels that correlate with high-urgency tickets, offering support teams actionable insights into customer emotion. An in-depth error analysis identifies key failure modes—such as class imbalance in high-priority tickets and occasional misrouting between semantically adjacent categories—and proposes mitigation strategies, including class-weighted loss and confidence-thresholding for low-confidence predictions. The pipeline reduces manual workload, enhances routing consistency, and surfaces dissatisfied customers for expedited handling. This work demonstrates the value of combining multi-task transformer classification with embedded sentiment analysis in a unified system, and provides practical recommendations for deployment and future enhancements in large-scale, multilingual help-desk environments.
